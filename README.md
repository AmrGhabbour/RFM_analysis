# RFM_analysis
RFM analysis project on Sales data

RFM analysis is a powerful way for brands to reliably segment their customers and learn a great deal about them. RFM analysis allows consumer brands to segment and rank their customers by value over a time period, using three dimensions:
Recency (how recently someone purchased),
Frequency (how frequently someone purchased) and 
Monetary (how much they spent, on average).

### Benefits of using RFM analysis:

- Boost remarketing strategy: helps your customers to purchase more frequently with mail and other ad types.
- More loyal customers: although some customers buy from you, they are not completely loyal to you. That is, you may need to make them feel special and show some attention.
- Better customer segmentation: RFM analysis allows businesses to segment their customers into specific segments based on their past behaviors. This is a crucial step to an effective marketing campaign.
- Cost-effective: RFM segmentation is an effective marketing strategy because it focuses on customer behavior, is customer-centric, cost-effective, and easy to implement.
- Easy to implement: Once youâ€™ve analyzed your customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value, you can now group or segment your customers.

### Calculating RFM Scores 

- Calculate an RFM score for each customer based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value.
- I assign a score of 1-5 for each dimension ( Recency, Frequency and monetary) based on the distribution of values in data set.
- Then combine these scores into a single score for each customer by concatinating the three dimensions values in order of(RFM).

### The results 
 - I recommend to focus more on follow up with Hibernating customers and At risk customers to not lose them offer more sales to attract them.
 - We could make rewards and special offers for Champions and potential loyalists customers.
